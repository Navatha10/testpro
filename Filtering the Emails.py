Filtering the Emails


# In[ ]:


Some mails are offering us deals or discounts. Some mails are asking passwords or personal information. All these mails are
looking fishy and spam .To separate these mails from the inbox.


# In[ ]:


The Question for this project is "Can we separate these unwanted mails from the inbox ?"

1 . Analytic Approach

Once the business problem has been clearly stated, the data scientist can define the analytic approach. 
Expressing the problem in the context of statistical and machine-learning techniques,so the data scientist
can identify the most suitable techniques for the desired outcome.
The problem requires a Inbox/Spam answer so we use classification model

2 . Data Requirements

Data requirements choice of analytic approach determines the data requirements,for the analytic methods 
to be used require certain data content, formats and representations.


# In[ ]:


3 . Data collection 

The data scientist identifies and gathers data resources- structured and unstructured data that are relevant to data.
The data scientist might need to revise the data requirements after encountering the gaps and collect more data if required.

4 . Data Understanding and Preparation

We use descriptive statistics and data evaluation techniques can understand data content, access data quality and discover 
initial insights into the data.
In the data preparation stage all activities used to construct the data set that will be used in the Modeling stage.
Data cleaning, merging data from variable sources and transforming data into variables.
Feature engineering and text analytics may be used to derive new structured variables to enhance the accuracy model.
Data preparation stage is the most time consuming.

5 . Modeling and Evaluation

Data scientists use a training set with the first prepared data. The historical data in which outcome is known.
Using the analytic approach we can develop the predictive or descriptive models. And the modeling process is highly iterative.
In the evaluation stage the data scientist evaluates the models quality. For this quality check we requires the computing 
of various diagnostic measures such as tables and graphs.
